# randoms

A small and simple web service that returns JSON formatted pseudorandom data - numbers, hexadecimal numbers, UUIDs, and base 64 strings. An excuse to try out [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/) and the companion web framework, [Kemal](http://kemalcr.com/). Originally considered as a useful idea as a data source for [Workflow](https://workflow.is/)
